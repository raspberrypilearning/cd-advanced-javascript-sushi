## Introduction

In these Sushi Cards you'll be building an app to get information from an **Application Programming Interface (API)** and display it to your user. Then you'll let them filter the information too. In the case of these Sushi Cards you'll be using the PokeAPI. It will let you get information about, and pictures of, Pok√©mon to display to your users. Once you're done, it'll look like this:

Since these are the Advanced JavaScript cards, you'll find the explanations are a bit less detailed than the earlier series, but you should be familiar with the basic pieces of JavaScript used in this program from the earlier series. I'll be talking more about what the code does, and why, than exactly *how* it manages it. 


### What you will make

Add something here to showcase here, for example:

<div class="scratch-preview">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/160619869/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

Add instructions here. These should explain either how the finished project will work, or explain how to interact with the content above.
