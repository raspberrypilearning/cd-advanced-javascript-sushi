## Introduction

Since this is an advanced JavaScript project, you'll find the explanations are a bit less detailed than simpler projects,so I recommend you not choose this as a first JavaScript project. I'll be talking more about what the code does, and why, than exactly *how* it manages it. 


### What you will make

In this project you'll be building an app to get information from an **Application Programming Interface (API)** and display it to your user. Then you'll let them filter the information too. In this case you'll be using the PokeAPI. It will let you get information about, and pictures of, Pok√©mon to display to your users. Once you're done, it'll look like this:

### What you will learn

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum){:target="_blank"}:

## Getting Setup

+ Go to [dojo.soy/js-a-start](http://dojo.soy/js-a-start). You will see a box containing an example JavaScript website project. On the right hand side is the website, and on the left hand side is the code that makes the website.

+ If you have an account on Trinket, click the **Remix** button at the top right of the project \(if you are not signed in, you will be prompted to do so. Once you've signed in you will then need to click the **Remix** button again\). This creates a copy of the project for you to work with.

It should say "remixed" after you click it

If you don't have an account on Trinket, you can save your work by using one of the options in the **Share** menu. You will get a link that you can either store somewhere, for example, in a document or send to someone via email.
Note: each time you make a change, you will get a new link.

---

You don't have to have an account on Trinket to work with these cards.
However, having one allows you to access your work easily from any computer. It also allows you to save a copy of a project somebody else has shared with you so you can make your own changes to it!

+ Go to [dojo.soy/trinket](http://dojo.soy/trinket) and click **Sign Up For Your Free Account** if you do not already have an account. You will need an email address to sign up. 

+ Enter your email address and choose a password, or ask somebody to do this for you.

+ You can now access all your saved or remixed projects by clicking on your username and going to **My Trinkets**.

+ You should also click on the drop-down arrow beside the **Autorun** button and select **Click To Run** instead. This makes sure that the code will only run when you click this button, not when you're halfway through typing it!
