## Introduction

This project will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a webpage, and will assume you've already worked with each of these languages. If you haven't, please start with a project like [To-do list](#) or [Project name](#) and try this project once you feel comfortable with the three web development languages and with concepts like functions and arrays in JavaScript, in particular.

### What you will make

In this project you'll be building an app to get information from an **Application Programming Interface (API)** and display it to your user. In this case you'll be getting information about different countries around the world. Once you're done, it'll look like this:

### What you will learn

* Connecting to an API and fetching information
* Using `async` and `await` to wait for a response
* Using functions to break up code and avoid repetition


## What you will need

This project uses [Trinket](https://trinket.io). You can find details on using Trinket, with or without an account, below. You will need a computer with an internet connection a web browser capable of accessing Trinket. As this project relies on an API hosted on the internet, it cannot be done offline.

You don't have to have an account on Trinket to work with these cards.
However, having one allows you to access your work easily from any computer. It also allows you to save a copy of a project somebody else has shared with you so you can make your own changes to it!

+ Go to [dojo.soy/trinket](http://dojo.soy/trinket) and click **Sign Up For Your Free Account** if you do not already have an account. You will need an email address to sign up.
